Personal
I'm Barath D, 26, B.Tech EIE graduate, now working in IT for a living. Kind of a lost soul here, not exactly new to programming but definitely new to development. This is my personal endeavor to master software development. I'll be treating this readme as a blog to capture my latest development and updates. Don't know if anyone is reading this, but this is purely for me to keep track.
